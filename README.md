Website with a Search Engine

Name: Ijaz Liaqat

Description Of Project:
This project requirements  a bit more work with APIs than was directly covered in the material. Technical requirements was following:
1) Website only needs to contain one HTMl page, but there should still be multiple links in your menu (even if they don't link to other pages)
2) There should be an input field (with a type of search) & a submit button
3) A user should be able to type in a search phrase, click submit, and your site should query the Giphy API based off of the search that the user has entered
4) Iterate through the returned data, and for each returned object in the array, find an image in the returned JSON and append that image to the screen

Technologies Used:
HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and Bootstrap.

Ideas for future improvement:

1) This Website can be impored by adding more features like Trending GIFs.
2) This Search Engine can be impored by categorization like Sports section, Entertainment etc.
3) this can be improve by adding funtionalty of GIFs, search results like 30,40 Gifs as per user input.
